Saverio (Left): According to my notes, a copper-iron ring has the lowest variation in bond length.
Saverio (Left): Unfortunately it is not perfect. If only there was a metal with properties between iron and copper, but no such metal exists.
Saverio (Left): I will change the formulation to have iron at the center. Should change the proportions subtly to have greater strength.
Saverio (Left): This will take quite a bit of quicksilver...
Saverio (Right): Jay! Have you finished cleaning up that lead yet?
Pugano (Left): Just about. Do you need the reagents prepared?
Saverio (Right): Certainly. I have an idea.

Pugano (Left): So this is your fantasy metal, then? The legendary copper-iron alloy?
Saverio (Right): Precisely. I think. It seems not to change shape in response to pressure, at least.
Saverio (Right): Consider if we applied this to the glyph of deposition. A delivered metal should find no space to dissolve, resulting in an unchanged metal as a result.
Pugano (Left): I suppose... but where are you going with this?
Saverio (Right): Now add some 'kick' to the process: elemental quicksilver, added to the mix.
Saverio (Right): The invariant metal forces the delivered metal to be deposited once more, but what of the quicksilver? It cannot become nothing, nor itself be deposited - what would happen to it?
Pugano (Left): I've no idea. Perhaps it gets ejected. Perhaps you'd break the machine.
Saverio (Right): Or perhaps we'd come away with more metal than we started! This is my theory.
Pugano (Left): _Hypothesis_. A doddering wizard's hypothesis.
Pugano (Left): I'd love to see you try, though. Could be a great laugh.
Saverio (Right): A doubter to the end, I see. Very well, keep working then, I will show you some genuine magic soon.
