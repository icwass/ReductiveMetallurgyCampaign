Portraits: Pugano (Right), Saverio (Right), Henley (Symposium)

Henley (Symposium): Labs at the University tend more toward functional and sterile, perhaps excessively so.
Henley (Symposium): Whereas this - this is quite the comfortable workshop you have here!
Saverio (Right): Yes, well, I'm rather keen on keeping the alchemy close at hand.
Action: Change, Saverio (Right), Saverio (Left)
Saverio (Left): Let me introduce my technical assistant, the marvelously proficient Jay Pugano.
Pugano (Right): Pleased to meet an Imperial scholar. I hope your arrival today isn't because of some wild fantasy you heard from my employer here.
Henley (Symposium): The pleasure is mine - call me Henley! Saverio simply suggested that he could create my catalyst at a lower cost.
Henley (Symposium): I assume this involves those reductive metallurgy glyphs of yours?
Action: Change, Saverio (Left), Saverio (Right)
Saverio (Right): Well, in this case it's a new glyph. It could be considered _additive_ metallurgy.
Pugano (Right): Amazing, you've made this absurdity sound marketable.
Pugano (Right): Saverio claims to make metal from nothing. I claim he is deceiving himself.
Henley (Symposium): This only makes me _more_ curious. Saverio, what could you possibly have in store?
Saverio (Right): Come and see, for I will have a demonstration machine prepared to make your catalyst!
