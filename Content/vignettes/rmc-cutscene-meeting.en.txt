Clara: Yet another freelancer alchemist coming to our court to grift snake oil, no doubt.
Clara: Well, let him in. Let's see how the princess will rebuke the dragon this time.
Action: Enter, Saverio (Left)
Clara: Welcome to House Soria, I hope the day has brought you good fortune. Your name was?

Saverio (Left): I do! It is right here, observe...
