Saverio (Left): Here it is. Using Ravari's wheel, I create an imprint that the quicksilver binds to, later reemerging as that metal.
Saverio (Left): I'm calling it the glyph of proliferation, as a result of these effects.
Saverio (Left): Since your catalyst requires several salt-derived elements, we can see how this compares to standard cardinal duplication.
Saverio (Left): Any questions?
Henley (Symposium): None from me, though I am very amused you've managed to get that ludicrous wheel to do anything of note.
Pugano (Left): Just run the machine, I want to see it for myself.

Saverio (Left): And there you have it! Quite simple, really.
Henley (Symposium): ... almost too simple.
Henley (Symposium): I agreed with Jay's skepticism, but it's clear the machine actually performs.
Pugano (Left): But material cannot be created from nothing! At least, it _shouldn't_.
Henley (Symposium): Quite the conundrum.
Henley (Symposium): At any rate, you seem capable of making my catalyst - let me know when the full order is done.
Henley (Symposium): As much as I'd like to be distracted by how this glyph works, there's quintessential research I need to get done!
