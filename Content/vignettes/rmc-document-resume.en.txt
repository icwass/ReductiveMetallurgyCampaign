[DO NOT PARSE]

This is the first text item. Every text item needs an associated entry in the DrawItems list for the document in RMC.advanced.yaml.

You can have multiple lines - the pound symbol is used to denote when to start the next text item.

#Note to self - stop putting coffee cups on important documents.
