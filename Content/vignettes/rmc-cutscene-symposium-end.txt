Portraits: Clara, Saverio (Right)

Clara: So what did the reductive metallurgist think of the latest alchemy has to offer?
Saverio (Right): I consider myself an _alchemical innovator_, it rather feels this reductive metallurgist title is set to make me just "that metals fellow".
Clara: Well, you have done good work in the field. Try it on for a bit - I'm sure someone like yourself will get inevitably bored of the feeling regardless.
Saverio (Right): Perhaps. I have found symposium is the field in microcosm. Some too focused on ambition and the appearance of prestige and others genuinely interested in furthering alchemy.
Saverio (Right): Strangely, I feel motivated by both of them.
Clara: As your apparent benefactor, this is good news.
Clara: Though I suppose you have no interest in doing alchemical research at a Great House.
Saverio (Right): Is House Soria not already gainfully employing alchemists?
Clara: We are, but they are quite dull characters. With enough attention, gaps could be identified.
Saverio (Right): Interesting, but as much as I appreciate the offer, you are right that I prefer the independence.
Saverio (Right): Just send us some orders, our workshop will be happy to have trusted partners.
Clara: I will keep it in mind. What is next for Saverio Daas then?
Saverio (Right): Invariant metal. A very special alloy, if I can make sense of its properties.
Clara: With such a name, I am already intrigued. Perhaps it will bring you to another Symposium.
Saverio (Right): Perhaps. Take care, Clara.
Clara: You as well. Have a good evening.
