Portraits: Saverio (Left), Pugano (Left)

Saverio (Left): Well, Mr. Pugano, I must say, you've surpassed expectations.
Saverio (Left): Why, if you had just a little more ambition, you could do very well for yourself.
Saverio (Left): But let's not linger on that. I have more use for you.
Pugano (Left): Has anyone ever told you that you sound like a villain?
Pugano (Left): Let's hear it then, what's the new task?
Saverio (Left): _Ahem_, you've seen how the glyph of rejection acts a counterpart to the glyph of projection.
Saverio (Left): The natural next step is to make a counterpart to the glyph of purification. I believe my theory is solid, but my practice has reached its limit.
Saverio (Left): Take my notes, see what you are able to do. I trust you'll work it out.
Pugano (Left): A tall order, but I'll see what I can muster.
