Pugano (Left): And here it is. This is my first time dabbling in glyph research, but I think these turned out well.
Saverio (Right): So how does it work?
Pugano (Left): Well, while your rejection glyph reverses the process of projection, these glyphs reverse the process of purification.
Saverio (Right): So it splits them apart, then! Neat.
Pugano (Left): However, it seems I can't perfect the process, so it's not an exact inverse of the purification glyph.
Saverio (Right): Still, rather impressive! Show me how it works.

Saverio (Right): Ooh, that's useful.
Saverio (Right): Rejection can extract quicksilver, but this can extract metal atoms!
Pugano (Left): Exactly. I want to tinker with them some more, but it should be a nice addition to our tool set.
