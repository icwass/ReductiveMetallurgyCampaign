Pugano (Left): And here it is. This is my first time dabbling in glyph research, but I think these turned out well.
Saverio (Right): Is this from my notes on reversing purification?
Pugano (Left): Well, the implementation was quite poor, but with some tinkering I got it working.
Saverio (Right): So it succeeds in splitting metals apart, then? This is excellent!
Pugano (Left): It's not quite a "split" - the metal is subjected to high pressure and deposited onto a membrane, then extracted. Observe:

-----------

Pugano (Left): As you can see, this results in two products of half the metallicity of the input. Alchemical laws remain intact.
Saverio (Right): Well, splitting can be a challenge for another time then.
Pugano (Left): What do you mean, "another time"? The law of equivalent exchange is sacrosanct, you cannot break it!
Saverio (Right): Just because it hasn't been done doesn't mean it can't be done!
Saverio (Right): Besides, the glyph of purification seems to _destroy_ metal. Where's the equivalent exchange there? 
Saverio (Right): Have some faith, Jay; my research into copper-iron alloys will soon bear fruit. For now, focus on improving the glyph's reliability - it will be important for future endeavors.
Pugano (Left): My financial security requires me to wish you the best of luck.
