Saverio (Left): Right, after that travesty, one would hope there is still some _alchemy_ occurring at the Symposium.
Saverio (Left): I see that the Imperial University has a presentation on... 'quintessence'?
Saverio (Left): Early results by Professor Tolomeo and H. Servin... I don't believe I am familiar with the latter.
Saverio (Left): Better hurry, it has already started.
Saverio (Left, Reversed): Ah, no, this way. Yes, here's the room. Quietly now...
Henley (Symposium): -ifth element has been the jewel of alchemical research for centuries, though this may show that it's not the sought after 'aether', but something different.
Henley (Symposium): At any rate, we seem to have finally synthesized it! No industrial applications are yet known, other than possibly serving as compact storage for the cardinals.
Henley (Symposium): We have prepared here a demonstration machine for its synthesis, using a polymer from the well-known alchemist that inspired us all!
Saverio (Left): ..._fascinating_.

Henley (Symposium): There is still more to discover, but this is the extent of our knowledge so far. Any questions?
Saverio (Left): Yes, I have a question: That rail construction that partially surrounds the chain reagent, what is that?
Henley (Symposium): Ah, this is called a guiding rail. It is required to feed the repeating reagent into the engine correctly.
Henley (Symposium): Quite the bespoke mechanism, though - I borrowed it from a tinkering friend of mine. Whether he finishes developing it for general use remains to be seen.
Saverio (Left): Ah, very interesting. Thank you for your presentation.
