Research Notes: Now to check the stability of planetary metals. Tin and lead have already been excluded, as they melt far too easily.
Research Notes: This next test will analyze those remaining - as the composition of the sample is changed, the apparatus analyzing the reagent and product vials should provide a comparative reading.

Research Notes: The copper-gold alloy had a better response than the pure silver sample.
Research Notes: Further testing is needed, but this is a promising lead.
