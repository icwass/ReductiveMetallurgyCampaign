Pugano (Right): Alright, Saverio, so far it seems your little experiments have shown no flaws, but this metal crystal will be the final judge.
Saverio (Left): It seems quite complicated, certainly. What does it do?
Pugano (Right): A ridiculous invention from my former workshop. It was supposed to make a magnificient pure white color for a firework charge, but it turned out to be incredibly flammable.
Pugano (Right): The vial it was stored in was just a little bit too tight and it spontaneously exploded. Some snots with familial ties to the owner decided to pin it on me, which brought me to you.
Saverio (Left): So you're deciding to bring it full circle then? Quite dramatic.
Pugano (Right): No, I just think it's suitable for a practical test. Let this be your lesson on rejection.
Saverio (Left): Okay, now you're definitely being dramatic. Let's see if the laws of alchemy reject me, then.
