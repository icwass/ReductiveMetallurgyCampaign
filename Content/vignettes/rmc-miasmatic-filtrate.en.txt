#Miasmatic Filtrate

#The paradigm surrounding metals and their conservation has shifted as reductive metallurgy becomes more widespread. No longer do alchemists fret the cost of refining metals to higher forms, and the Midas Endgame is now a quaint fiction instead of a nightmarish possibility.

And with it, we see more alchemists design processes that perform Recyclingâ€” the act of decomposing an alchemical compound back into its constituent essences. Although this is not a new type of process (as Recycling cabinets for disposing certain expired tonics have existed as far back as the Imperial era), it had limited capacity when it came to metal reagents. With reductive metallurgy, recovering metallic inputs is now trivial in comparision, as is demonstrated here by decomposing Miasmatic Filter into its original reagents.
