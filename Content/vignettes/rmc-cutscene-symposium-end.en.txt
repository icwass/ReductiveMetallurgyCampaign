Portraits: Clara, Saverio (Left)

Clara: So what did our reductive metallurgist think of the latest that alchemy has to offer?
Saverio (Left): 'Reductive metallurgist'... it rather feels this title is set to make me just 'that metals fellow'.
Clara: Well, you have done good work in the field. Try it on for a bit - though I'm sure someone like yourself will get bored of the feeling, regardless.
Saverio (Left): Possibly. At any rate, I found Symposium to be the field in microcosm: some too focused on ambition and the appearance of prestige, others genuinely interested in furthering alchemy.
Saverio (Left): Strangely, I feel motivated by both of them.
Clara: Glad to see my support was well-placed!
Clara: Though I suppose you have no interest in doing alchemical research at a Great House.
Saverio (Left): Is House Soria not already gainfully employing alchemists?
Clara: Only the one, and he certainly tries his best, but his best is dull compared to your sparkling work.
Saverio (Left): You flatter me. As much as I appreciate the offer, you are right that I prefer the independence.
Saverio (Left): Just send us some orders - our workshop will be happy to have trusted partners.
Clara: I will keep it in mind. What is next for Saverio Daas, then?
Saverio (Left): Invariant metal. A very special alloy, if I can make sense of its composition.
Clara: With such a name, I am already intrigued. Perhaps it will bring you to another Symposium!
Saverio (Left): Perhaps! Take care, Clara.
Clara: And to you as well.
