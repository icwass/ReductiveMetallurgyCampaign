Saverio (Left): And apparently a nasty smell about you.
Saverio (Left): Ah, you are drunk!
Pugano (Right): _Was_ drunk. Can you be clever somewhere else, please?
Saverio (Left): That is my plan. I will be in my study finalizing my latest research. Please don't bother me unless it is important.
Saverio (Left): And for goodness sake, get yourself cleaned up. Go find my schematics on some sanitizing dust.
Pugano (Right): _burp_, sure thing. Watch out for strewn lead, it may be all over the floor.
Saverio (Left): _sigh_, I am going to choose to not ask questions.
Pugano (Right): Alright, let's see those schematics...

Pugano (Left): Nothing like some alchemy to work through a hangover.
Pugano (Right): Saverio's gone into his hole for the day, and there's no orders to fulfill.
Pugano (Left): Guess I'll clean up and try not to sleep on a workshop floor tonight.
