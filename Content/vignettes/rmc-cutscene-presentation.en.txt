Portraits: Saverio (Right)

Saverio (Right): And so, the glyphs of rejection and deposition serve at the forefront of a new field of alchemical development, that of _reductive metallurgy_.
Saverio (Right): The work I have shown today has been the result of research by me and my workshop. No protoype assemblages are available at this time, but we would be happy to hear about interest.
Saverio (Right): I would like to extend my gratitude to House Soria, who sponsored my attendance today, and my alchemical technician, Jay Pugano, who is doubtlessly working furiously on our next innovations.
Saverio (Right): This concludes my presentation. Thank you all for coming.
Symposium Attendees: (_clapping_)
Action: Change, Saverio (Right), Saverio (Left)
Saverio (Left): Phew.
Action: Enter, Clara
Clara: Surprisingly, you managed not to seem like a lunatic in front of esteemed alchemists.
Clara: Though there seems to be a lot of muttering.
Saverio (Left): Certainly, they most likely have the same initial objection as you: whyever diminish gold?
Saverio (Left): As long as some of them see the possibilities, I will consider this a success.
Clara: Pragmatic, I see. Good luck then, I see a particularly dour alchemist coming now. Let us see how you handle him.
Action: Enter, Verrin Ravari
Verrin Ravari: Ah, Clara. It has been too long. You've found yourself an interesting one.
Clara: Perhaps one day it will be longer yet. No time to chat, I was only here to act as benefactor.
Verrin Ravari: Not concerning, I would like to talk to this proclaimed reductive metallurgist.
Saverio (Left): Dour, indeed.
