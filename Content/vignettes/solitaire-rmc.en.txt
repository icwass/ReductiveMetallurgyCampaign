Pugano (Right): Ah, taking a break with a nice game of Sigmarâ€™s Garden, I see.
Saverio (Left): Yes, but I'm trying to spice it up a bit by including more of each metal.
Pugano (Right): How would that work?
Saverio (Left): Well, you need to clear all of the lead atoms before you can clear any tin, for example.
Pugano (Right): Ah, that's reasonable. Compatible with the original game, in fact.
Pugano (Right): Well, go on then, I want to see how it plays out.
 
----- After winning 1 game.
 
Saverio (Left): Well, it certainly plays differently.
Pugano (Right): A bit tricky, what with the extra metals locking up more of the board.
Pugano (Right): And with several of the same metal tier, one must choose which to eliminate first.
Saverio (Left): True. But I do like the extra sheen the iron and copper proxies provide.
Pugano (Right): "Iron and copper, copper and iron", do you ever stop thinking about them?
Saverio (Left): Not really, no.
 
----- After winning 10 games.
 
Saverio (Left): Nice, 10 games.
 
----- After winning 25 games.
 
Saverio (Left): Wow, 25 games.
 
----- After winning 50 games.
 
Saverio (Left): Amazing, 50 games.
 
----- After winning 75 games.
 
Saverio (Left): Sheesh, 75 games.
 
----- After winning 100 games.
 
Saverio (Left): Holy shit, 100 games.
