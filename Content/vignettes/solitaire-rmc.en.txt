Pugano (Right): Ah, taking a break with a nice game of Sigmarâ€™s Garden, I see.
Saverio (Left): Yes, but I'm trying to spice it up a bit by including more metals.
Pugano (Right): How would that work?
Saverio (Left): Well, you need to clear all of the lead atoms before you can clear any tin, for example.
Saverio (Left): Additionally, you can match two metals if they are the same.
Pugano (Right): Ah, that's reasonable.
Saverio (Left): And techincally, it's compatible with the original game!
Pugano (Right): Well, go on then, I want to see how it plays out.
 
----- After winning 1 game.
 
Saverio (Left): Well, it certainly plays differently.
Pugano (Right): A bit tricky, what with the metals locking up more of the board.
Pugano (Right): And you need to carefully ration your quicksilver, or you can get stuck.
Saverio (Left): True. But I do like the extra sheen the iron and copper proxies provide.
Pugano (Right): "Iron and copper, copper and iron", do you ever stop thinking about them?
Saverio (Left): Not really, no.
 
----- After winning 10 games.
 
Pugano (Right): I can't believe you're still playing that game. Don't we have work to do?
Saverio (Left): Don't forget who's paying who.
Saverio (Left): Besides, we're not in a big rush at the moment. It's not as if we have some nefarious plot to execute.
Pugano (Right): ...please keep it that way.
 
----- After winning 25 games.
 
Saverio (Left): Good gravy, have I played this many games already?
Saverio (Left, Reversed): At least the playtester seems to be enjoying this variant of Sigmar's Garden.
Saverio (Left): But I'm running out of things to say! The devs haven't actually written this much dialogue yet.
Pugano (Right): Stop making fourth-wall breaks, I beg of you.
Saverio (Left): Maybe they could suggest something...
 
----- After winning 50 games.
 
Saverio (Left): Amazing, 50 games.
Verrin Ravari: What lazy writing.
Verrin Ravari (Frustrated): And why am _I_ here anyway?
 
----- After winning 75 games.
 
Saverio (Left): Sheesh, 75 games.
Verrin Ravari (Frustrated): And _repetive_ writing, too!
Verrin Ravari (Frustrated): I hope the playtester is in it for the solitaire - the dialogue leaves much to be desired.
 
----- After winning 100 games.
 
Saverio (Left): Holy shit, 100 games.
Verrin Ravari (Livid): WRITE SOME ACTUAL DIALOGUE
