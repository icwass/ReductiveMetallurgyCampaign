Saverio (Right): Dear assistant.
Pugano (Left): Uh-huh.
Saverio (Right): Dearest, beloved assistant.
Pugano (Left): Okay, what did you do?
Saverio (Right): You know that new glyph I gave you, that you've just started working with and understand perfectly?
Pugano (Left): You mean the one _I_ got working three days ago?
Saverio (Right): Ancient history, my friend. A customer has bulk ordered some solder wire, so I'll need you to make some, and quickly.
Pugano (Left): What, bu-... how do you suppose we find the material for this much wire?
Saverio (Right): They _did_ give us an advance, use that. It should provide plenty of material.

Saverio (Right): I must say, it's quite remarkable how well you work under pressure.
Pugano (Left): ...
Pugano (Left): Gracious leader, how nice of you to give me the remainder of the advance from this assignment.
Pugano (Left): I will use it wonderfully these next few days you've given me off.
Saverio (Right): I- uh, fine. I am ever so gracious after all.
