[DO NOT PARSE]

Journal pages!

#The puzzles that used to be Chapter 5 have been moved to a new journal page. The puzzles that appear here are additional puzzles that I threw together. Miasmatic Filtrate is the puzzle that appears in the trailer, and Vestan Regulus is obviously based off of Martial Regulus, just with metal changes for lore and rate reasons.

It would be nice to have two journal pages instead of one (so the old Chapter 5 puzzles could be split better by theme and difficulty), but I don't know if these are good puzzles to do that with, nor if we can even get another 5 puzzles for the journal - feedback would be appreciated.
