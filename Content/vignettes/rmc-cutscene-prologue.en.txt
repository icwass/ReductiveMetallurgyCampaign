Portraits: Anataeus, Concordia

Concordia: So the machine oil is _not_ ready for the observatory, then?
Anataeus: Unfortunately, this product is composed of iron, not tin...
Concordia: Sounds like the great House Alchemist made a mistake!
Anataeus: I'm not even sure how, but yes. Breaking this back down into individual components will be straightforward, but the metallic reagents are irrecoverable, to an extent.
Anataeus: If only I hadn't over-projected the lead.
Concordia: Something something good transition. Surely not every graduate from the College of Alchemical Engineering can be employed as a House Alchemist.
Anataeus: Correct... I believe several of them work as freelance alchemists. In the streets somewhere, I assume.
