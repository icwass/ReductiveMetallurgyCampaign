Portraits: Saverio (Left), Pugano (Right)

Pugano (Right): ...
Saverio (Left): ...
Pugano (Right): ...this is by far the most impressive thing I've seen you do, yet.
Saverio (Left): That was horrifying.
Pugano (Right): It folded in on itself like a wounded animal.
Saverio (Left): Like some pole vaulter's nightmare scenario.
Pugano (Right): You made the transmutation engine cannabilize itself, from the look of it.
Pugano (Right): Those are _expensive_, you know.
Saverio (Left): This at least explains the effect of the invariant metal. The engine itself becomes a battery for quicksilver, paying the tax that the glyph itself does not.
Saverio (Left): This certainly demands more research. I hear House Soria is looking for a new head alchemist, will you join me?
Pugano (Right): Pfft. Hah! Ba-hahahaha!
Pugano (Right): Amid disaster, you simply blink twice and look to the next thing!
Pugano (Right): Alright, Mr. _Daas_. I'll keep being first seat to your magnificient show. If you pay me, of course.
