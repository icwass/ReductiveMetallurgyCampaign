Portraits: Saverio (Left), Pugano (Right)

Pugano (Right): ...
Pugano (Right): ...this is by far the most impressive thing I've seen you do, yet.
Saverio (Left): That was horrifying.
Pugano (Right): It folded in on itself like a wounded animal.
Saverio (Left): Or some pole vaulter's nightmare scenario.
Pugano (Right): The transmutation engine cannabilized itself, from the look of it.
Pugano (Right): Those are _expensive_, you know.
Saverio (Left): At least this explains the effect of the invariant metal. The engine itself becomes an exchange for the quicksilver, paying the debt that the glyph does not.
Saverio (Left): This certainly demands more research. I will need to close the shop for some time.
Saverio (Left): I hear House Soria is looking for good alchemists - care to join me?
Pugano (Right): Pfft. Hah! Ba-hahahaha!
Pugano (Right): Amid disaster, you simply blink twice and look to the next thing!
Pugano (Right): Alright, _Mr. Daas_. I'll keep the front-row seat to your magnificient show. As long as I'm paid, of course.
Saverio (Left): Excellent. Now to dispose of this... corpse.
