Saverio (Left): Ooh, we got an interesting order today.
Pugano (Right): For what?
Saverio (Left): House Soria wants precision machine oil, and a lot of it.
Pugano (Right): But of course they'd want machine oil, they need to keep that observatory maintained.
Pugano (Right): Well, let's start making it, I guess.
Saverio (Left): No, no, no, you misunderstand.
Saverio (Left): They don't want to buy some oil. 
Saverio (Left): They want to buy _a transmutation engine_.
Pugano (Right): Oho, now THAT'S interesting!

-----------

Pugano (Right): There you go, madam: one cabinet engine for producing machine oil.
Clara: Thank you so much, gentlemen - have a good rest of the day!
Saverio (Left): Take care!
Saverio (Left): Another satisfied customer.
Pugano (Right): It would have been easier to use tin, of course, but it's clever to reuse the iron dust generated by machining gears and such.
Pugano (Right): Good job putting that in the specification.
Saverio (Left): Oh, that wasn't my idea - it was the customer's.
Pugano (Right): What?
Saverio (Left): For a House noble, she has a good head on her shoulders.
