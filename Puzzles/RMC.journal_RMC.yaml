  Title: "Volume XCX, Issue I: Developmental Prototypes from Reductive Metallurgy"
  Description: "In the course of any sort of development, it is inevitable some work will be deemed unsuited for prime consumption, and instead remain permanently shelved. It is not in the spirit of Reductive Metallurgy to leave such materials in disuse, however, so they are provided here as reference. For prototypes where communication documents were available, the drafts have been provided, though they may not reflect reality."
