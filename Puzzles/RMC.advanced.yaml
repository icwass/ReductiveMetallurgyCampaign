    Title: "Glyph of Rejection"
    Description: "The *glyph of rejection* can demote an atom of metal to its next lower form, producing an atom of quicksilver.\n\nBy doing this repeatedly, even gold — the finest metal — can be transmuted into base lead."

    Title: "Ravari's Wheel"
    Description: "By using *Ravari's wheel* with the glyphs of projection and rejection, quicksilver can be stored or discharged.\n\nBecause it has metals with differing amounts of available quicksilver, Ravari's wheel could be called \"the metallurgist’s buffer.\""

    Title: "Direct Quicksilver Transfer"
    Description: "It is possible to use *Ravari's wheel* without manually handling the quicksilver.\n\nBy placing the wheel above the _quicksilver_ port of the glyphs of projection or rejection, one can directly transfer the quicksilver in and out of the wheel."
